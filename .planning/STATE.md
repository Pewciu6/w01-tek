# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-05)

**Core value:** A text instruction typed to a RAI agent makes simulated Wojtek walk, navigate to a goal, and describe what its camera sees, using the production ROS 2 interfaces unchanged.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Isolated RAI Environment

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Isolated RAI Environment) — EXECUTING
Plan: 5 of 5
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-09-07 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Velocity arbiter (MOT-02) sits inside Phase 3 before any agent-published motion — the agent never gets a direct path to `cmd_vel`
- [Roadmap]: Vision (Phase 4) precedes navigation (Phase 5) — the robot-state/pose tool is evidence navigation needs, and it defers the highest-risk work
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 creates the single ReAct agent and its tool registry; Phases 3-5 register tools into it
- [Phase 01]: Task 1 checkpoint: run.sh owns the wojtek_robot container lifecycle (option-a), replicating ros/sim.sh's/ros/dev.sh's platform-detection branch, to keep zero edits under ros/
- [Phase 01]: Resolved rai_interfaces tag 0.3.0 to commit 2398f1f3e4c96d790365492294599439a38cdf9a via a fresh git ls-remote at execution time, pinning it in ros/rai_interfaces.repos rather than the main branch upstream pins.
- [Phase 01]: Phase 01 plan 03: added a read-only .env.example bind mount to compose.override.yaml and a git-unreachable fallback in the secret-scan guard, since the wojtek_robot container only bind-mounts the experiment dir + ros/src (D-02), not the repo's .git or root files
- [Phase 01]: Widened the wojtek_robot container's compose override with a read-write repo-root mount (/ros2_ws/repo_root) — Two of plan 01-04's guard tests need to see ros/, training/ and ros/deploy.sh, and its boundary-pair fail-first demo needs write access one level outside the experiment dir; none of D-02's existing mounts reached any of that.
- [Phase 01]: Fixed a vacuous pre-existing guard test: test_repos_pin.py's ros/src check had been scanning a nonexistent path inside the container since plan 01-02 — conftest.py's repo_root fixture now prefers the new repo_root mount, so the ros/src scan actually sees ros/src; demonstrated fail-first with a probe path, reverted.
- [Phase 01]: Task 2 checkpoint resolved: operator authorized the executing agent to drive the aarch64 dev box over the operator's own SSH access, keeping the alias/host/login out of the repo and the agent's context
- [Phase 01]: FOUND-07 marked discharged with a caveat: default DDS profile hangs on the aarch64 dev box, ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1 verified as a workaround, recorded rather than concealed

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: SCAN-Planner is sim-only and ROS-less today. Decide SCAN-Planner ROS wrapping vs. Nav2 in a spike *before* Phase 5 planning (effort, Jetson portability, quadruped tuning).
- [Phase 1]: `rai-core==2.12.0` leaves LangChain/LangGraph unpinned. Lock resolved versions on first successful install or the environment drifts.
- [Phase 3]: Trained velocity envelope (max vx/vy/wz) must be read from `training/docs/configuration.md` before the clamp is written.
