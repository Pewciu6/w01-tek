# Container lifecycle decision (Phase 1 plan 01-01, Task 1 checkpoint,
# option-a): this script owns bringing up `wojtek_robot` itself -- with the
# experiment's compose override always attached -- rather than relying on
# ros/sim.sh or ros/dev.sh to have started it with the override already in
# place. Neither of those scripts has an extension point for an extra
# compose file, and each recreates the container on its own `up -d`, so
# whichever script runs last would silently drop the other's compose stack.
# `container`, below, replicates the exact platform-detection branch
# ros/sim.sh and ros/dev.sh already use, so the result is identical to what
# they would produce, plus this experiment's bind mount. ros/sim.sh,
# ros/dev.sh and ros/docker/ are never edited to make this work.
