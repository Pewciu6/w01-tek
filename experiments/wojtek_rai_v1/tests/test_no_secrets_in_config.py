"""Secret-shape and private-infrastructure-identity guard over tracked config.

Pattern source: `training/tests/unit/test_job_scripts.py` (`FORBIDDEN_RE` /
`SITE_VALUE_RE` / `ABSOLUTE_PATH_RE`), read this session -- same shape
(module-level compiled regex constants, a `Path`-returning discovery
helper, one assert-with-diagnostic-message per check), retargeted here for
API-key shapes and for the identity of private infrastructure rather than
scheduler/host identity.

What this suite checks: every file `git ls-files` reports as tracked under
`experiments/wojtek_rai_v1/`, plus the repo-root `.env.example`, contains no
value shaped like a vendor/tracing credential (FOUND-04) and no value
identifying private infrastructure -- a dotted-quad IP address, a
`user@host` login form, or an `ssh`/`scp`/`rsync` invocation naming a
remote host (CLAUDE.md's public-repository rule).

What this suite deliberately does NOT check: whether a value is *actually*
a live credential or a real host -- only whether it is *shaped* like one.
This is model-free: no `rclpy`, no LLM key, no GPU, no network (FOUND-06).

Both scans are proven fail-first by the two `test_*_regex_detects_*` tests
below, which build a violating string from parts at runtime rather than
writing an example credential or host identity into this source file.

**Container execution note:** this suite normally runs inside the
`wojtek_robot` container via `run.sh test`, where only this experiment's
own directory (plus `ros/src`) is bind-mounted (D-02) -- there is no `.git`
anywhere inside that mount, so `git ls-files` cannot run there.
`tracked_config_files()` detects this (no `.git` reachable by walking
upward from this file) and falls back to a plain directory walk that
excludes exactly what this experiment's own `.gitignore` excludes, which
can only over-scan relative to `git ls-files`, never under-scan. The
root `.env.example` is similarly unreachable inside that mount by default;
`docker/compose.override.yaml` adds one additional read-only bind mount of
just that single file (already public, secret-free by design -- it is a
template of placeholder names) at the container path this fallback expects,
so the scan can still cover it.
