"""Model-free coverage of `wojtek_rai.topics`.

Covers the four behaviours this module promises:
  1. format_topics() renders a stable one-line-per-topic string with name + type
  2. format_topics([]) returns a non-empty "no topics" message, not ""
  3. importing wojtek_rai.topics never pulls rclpy into sys.modules
     (the rclpy/rai imports inside list_topics() are function-local)
  4. wojtek_rai.topics.main is callable and accepts an optional argv sequence

This suite needs no ROS 2, no LLM key, and no GPU (FOUND-06) -- with one
documented exception: `test_main_is_callable_with_optional_argv` below
performs real ROS 2 I/O and is marked `ros_io` accordingly (see WR-02 in
01-REVIEW.md).

    # multicast-loopback shutdown defect that hung exactly this class of
    # test for 31 minutes on real hardware before being killed. The
    # `timeout(30)` guard turns a repeat of that defect into a fast, clear
    # failure instead of a silent multi-minute stall; `ros_io` lets a
    # profile that cannot tolerate any live ROS I/O deselect just this one
