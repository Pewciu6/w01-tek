"""Isolation-boundary guard: nothing outside this directory imports it, and
`ros/deploy.sh` cannot ship it to the robot.

What this repository cares about, per CLAUDE.md's `experiments/` rule and
the sibling experiment's isolation rules (FOUND-01): (1) no file under
`ros/`, `training/` or a repository-root shell entry point references this
experiment by name; (2) no path under `ros/src/` -- the tree
`ros/deploy.sh` rsyncs to the robot -- matches this experiment's name or
`rai`; (3) every local source `ros/deploy.sh`'s rsync invocations read from
resolves inside `ros/` itself, never outside it. What this test
deliberately does NOT check: whether a name match is a real Python import
vs. a comment or a string -- a name match anywhere outside this directory
is already the violation FOUND-01 forbids, regardless of syntax.

`.planning/` is deliberately excluded from every scan in this file:
planning documents (PLAN.md/SUMMARY.md/RESEARCH.md, ...) legitimately name
this experiment throughout its own phase directory, and scanning them would
make this guard fail on the very commits that describe the experiment.
None of this file's scans include `.planning/` in their target list.

This suite is model-free: no `rclpy`, no LLM key, no GPU, no network
(FOUND-06) -- `grep` and the standard library only.
